We make a site for a small, provincial theater. The city N, where the theater is, does not have a lot of public, so the performances are held strictly once a day, at 19:00.

First of all, we have to implement a poster. We have a theater administrator, Mrs. Turner, a respected woman. She will make a schedule of performances.

The performance is characterized by the following properties:

- Name
- Start date (02/19/2019)
- End date (03/21/2019)

We have create, index, delete methods.

When adding a new performance, if we already have a performance for these dates - we display an error.
